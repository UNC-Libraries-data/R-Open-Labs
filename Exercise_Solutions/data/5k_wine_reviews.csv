Italy,"Candied fruit and caramel ride on the back of maple syrup, allspice and ground ginger. Marsala is for much more than cooking and you can try this wine with aged cheese or as an after-dinner drink.",Fine Sweet,88,12,Sicily & Sardinia,Marsala,Florio NV Fine Sweet  (Marsala),Catarratto,Florio
US,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah blend is soft and ready to drink now. It's also very delicious, almost like a dessert pastry, with ultra-ripe black cherry, cassis, anise liqueur, melted milk chocolate and vanilla flavors that finish spicy-sweet.",Le Petit Vice,88,50,California,Sonoma-Napa,Vice Versa 2005 Le Petit Vice Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Sonoma-Napa),Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,Vice Versa
Chile,"Pungent, zesty and quite varietal in its expression. The nose is racy and intense, with nettle, sweat and passion fruit aromas. Expect a wet, almost spritzy palate with green-edged fruit flavors and light herbaceousness. There's bite and sass to this one, and the finish is quite long.",Reserva Especial,88,19,Casablanca Valley,,Viña Mar de Casablanca 2008 Reserva Especial Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),Sauvignon Blanc,Viña Mar de Casablanca
