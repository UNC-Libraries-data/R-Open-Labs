## Motivation: Joining and Reshaping with tidyr

In most of our lessons so far, we've typically focused on a single dataset. This week, we'll cover different methods for combining multiple datasets and transforming the shape of our data.

When using data that includes similar observational units collected by different sources, we will often find ourselves with multiple datasets that need to be combined before we can begin analysis. For example, if we wanted to gather various pieces of information for all of the countries in the world, we'd need to **merge** or **join** multiple datasets coming from the UN, the World Bank, the World Health Organization, etc. Or, we may simply need to add observations to an existing dataset (e.g. if we have multiple datasets coming from the World Bank, but each dataset only covers a single year.)

In other cases, we might need to reshape data we already have to make it more appropriate for other software, for analysis, or easier to use within R. If you're planning to export data from R to another software package, you may need a particular format. For example, mapping software like ArcGIS needs each row of a dataset to represent a geographic location.

## Merging / Joining Dataframes

### Appending

Sometimes we'll have two datasets with similar columns that we need to combine. Essentially, we are stacking the rows of those datasets on top of each other. We can combine rows in `dplyr` with `bind_rows`:

**Dataset 1**

```{r}
a0 <- data.frame("StudentID"=c(1,2),
                 "GPA_change"=rnorm(2,0,1))

print(a0)
```

**Dataset 2**

```{r}
a1 <- data.frame("StudentID"=c(3,4),
                 "GPA_change"=rnorm(2,0,1),
                 "Semester"=c("Spring","Fall"))

print(a1)
```

**Datasets combined**

```{r}
bind_rows(a0,a1)
```

When we refer to **merging** or **joining**, we usually do not mean appending or adding observations to a dataset in this way. Instead, joining usuallly intends to add columns or variables to our dataframe. R does have a bind_cols function, but in the context below, using bind_cols is unhelpful and results in mismatched records.

```{r}
b0 <- data.frame("name"=c("Marcos","Crystal"),
                 "year"=c(1993,1996))

b1 <- data.frame("name"=c("Crystal","Marcos"),
                 "project_num"=c(6,3))

bind_cols(b0,b1)
```

Instead, we want to add columns while making sure certain identifying variables, often called **keys** (e.g. `name` and `name1` above) line up correctly. That way, each row represents information about a single observational unit.

### Merging

#### Keys

To properly line up observations between two datasets, we need a common variable (or group of variables) that uniquely identifies an observation in at least one of the datasets, and identifies it in the same way across both datasets. This variable is usually called a "key". In our example above, `b0` and `b1` have the key "name".

```{r}
print(b0)

print(b1)
```

Once we have matching key variable(s) in our datasets, we can join our datasets into consistent observations. There are two major categories of joins - "Inner Joins" and "Outer Joins".

### Types of Joins

We need several different types of joins to facillitate the different ways datasets are organized.

| Join Type              | Want to keep                                                                                  | Function       |
|------------------|------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Inner Join**         | Only the rows in both datasets                                                                | `inner_join()` |
| **Full (Outer) Join**  | All of the rows                                                                               | `full_join()`  |
| **Left (Outer) Join**  | All of the rows in the first (left) dataset, only the matches from the second (right) dataset | `left_join()`  |
| **Right (Outer) Join** | All of the rows in the second (left) dataset, only the matches from the first (right) dataset | `right_join()` |

The join types can be represented as Venn Diagrams. The lighter parts of the circles represent unmatched records we are leaving out of the join, while the darker parts represent both matched and unmached records we are keeping in the join.

![Join Types from R for Data Science 13.4.3](figures/join-venn-dark.png)

Take a look at these two datasets:

```{r}
b0 <- data.frame("name"=c("Marcos","Crystal","Devin","Lilly"),
                 "year"=c(1993,1996,1985,2001))

b1 <- data.frame("person"=c("Marcos","Crystal","Devin","Tamera"),
                 "project_num"=c(6,3,9,8))
```

```{r}
print(b0)
```

```{r}
print(b1)
```

Now, let's merge them using each of the different join types.

#### Inner Join

##### `inner_join`

```{r warning=FALSE}
inner_join(b0,b1,by=c("name"="person"))
```

#### Outer Joins

##### `full_join`

```{r warning=FALSE}
full_join(b0,b1,by=c("name"="person"))
```

##### `left_join`

```{r warning=FALSE}
left_join(b0,b1,by=c("name"="person"))
```

##### `right_join`

```{r warning=FALSE}
right_join(b0,b1,by=c("name"="person"))
```

*Note: All of these join functions come from the `dplyr` package, so we can use them with pipes ( %\>% )*

### Extensions

#### Multiple Keys

In some cases, we may need multiple keys to uniquely identify an observation. For example, our datasets below have two different observations for each person, so we need to join them by both name and year.

```{r}
multi0 <- data.frame("name"=c("Tamera","Zakir","Zakir","Tamera"),
                     "year"=c(1990,1990,1991,1991),
                     "state"=c("NC","VA","VA","NY"))

multi1 <- data.frame("person"=c("Tamera","Zakir","Zakir","Tamera"),
                     "year"=c(1990,1990,1991,1991),
                     "project_num"=c(6,3,9,8))

multijoined <- inner_join(multi0,multi1,
                          by=c("name"="person","year"="year"))

multijoined
```

#### Many-to-one and One-to-many Joins

If we only specify enough key variables to uniquely identify observations in one dataset and not the other, each unique value from the first dataset will be joined to each instance of that value in the other dataset.

```{r}
statedata <- data.frame("state"=c("NC","VA","NY"),
                        "region"=c("Southeast","Southeast","Northeast"))

inner_join(statedata,multijoined,by=c("state"="state"))
```

*Note: We can equivalently omit `by=c("state"="state")` since the key variables have the same name here.*

## Reshaping with tidyr

Once we have a single dataset, we may still need to change its shape. When we talk about the **shape** of a dataset, we are often referring to whether it is wide or long.

-   **Wide dataset** - typically includes more columns and fewer rows with a single row for each observation

-   **Long dataset** - typically includes fewer columns and more rows with multiple rows for each observation

The many functions used in R for changing a datasets' shape have varied over the years along with the terminology (e.g. "reshape", "melt", "cast", "tidy", "gather", "spread", "pivot", etc.) We will now be working with the new reshaping functions recommended by [tidyverse](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html), `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`.

*Hadley Wickham's [Tidy Data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html) provides more discussion of what "Tidy Data" entails and why it's useful in data analysis.*

#### Use Case: Making `ggplot` easier

Why reshape when we have perfectly good data? Sometimes R's own functions are more convenient with reshaped data. Consider the dataset below in which we've generated random numbers for columns A and B.

```{r}
set.seed(123)

df0 <- data.frame(year=c(2000,2001,2002),
                  A=runif(3,0,20),
                  B=runif(3,0,20))

print(df0)
```

Now we want to create a line plot in which each column has its own line. Because our dataset is **wide**, we'll need to add each line to the plot separately and individually.

```{r}
ggplot(data=df0,aes(x=year)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=A),color="red") +
  geom_line(aes(y=B),color="blue") + 
  theme_bw()
```

However, if we were using a **long** dataset, we could create the plot with less code. Note how our dataset below has a single column for categories A and B.

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(year=c(df0$year,df0$year),
                  category=c("A","A","A","B","B","B"),
                  value=c(df0$A,df0$B))

print(df1)
```

And for our plot, we only need to add a single `geom_line` while using the category column for our `color` aesthetic.

```{r}
ggplot(data=df1,aes(x=year,y=value,color=category))+
  geom_line()+
  theme_bw()
```

This may not seem like much of a big deal for this particular plot, but what if we were trying to plot hundreds of lines?

We can move back and forth between the long shape used by `df1` and the wide shape used by `df0` with tidyr's `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider` functions.

### `pivot_longer`

First, let's create a small example dataset with four columns of randomly generated numbers.

```{r}
set.seed(123)

raw <- data.frame(
  City=c("Raleigh","Durham","Chapel Hill"),
  x2000=rnorm(3,0,1),
  x2001=rnorm(3,0,1),
  x2002=rnorm(3,0,1),
  x2003=rnorm(3,0,1)
)

print(raw)
```

*x2000 through x2003 represent something measured in 2000 to 2003, since R data.frames cannot have labels that start with numbers.*

In the dataset above, we have information stored in separate columns for each year, but it might be more useful to store the year number itself in its own column. We can use the `pivot_longer` function to do this.

`pivot_longer` takes four main arguments:

1.  data: this must be a **data frame**.

2.  cols: a **list of column names** that we want to pivot into a single column.

3.  names_to: the **name** of the new column that will contain the names of the columns we are pivoting.

4.  values_to: the **name** of another new column that will contain values of the columns we are pivoting.

We can also use various other arguments with pivot_longer that allow us to do a number of handy things. For example, the names_prefix argument lets us remove the "x" in front of our year names. Run ?pivot_longer in your console for a full list of arguments that can be used.

```{r warning=FALSE}
longpivot <- raw |>
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("x"), 
               names_to = "Year", 
               values_to = "Value", 
               names_prefix = "x")

print(longpivot)
```

It's often useful to think about how transformations like pivot_longer change the effective observational unit of the dataset. This dataset started with city-level observations in which each row was represented by a unique city name. The transformed data frame longpivot now observes one city in a given year in each row, so we now have multiple rows for the same city.

### `pivot_wider`

We can reverse our previous transformation with `pivot_wider`. This time, we'll create a separate column for each city.

`pivot_wider` takes three essential arguments:

1.  data

2.  names_from: the **column** whose values we'll use to create new column names.

3.  values_from: another **column** whose values we'll use to fill the new columns.

```{r}
widepivot <- longpivot |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = City, values_from = Value)

print(widepivot)
```

Why would we want each city to have its own column? Well, it might be a useful step to determine which cities are most closely correlated as part of an Exploratory Data Analysis process. For example, we can now easily use this dataset with ggally to create a plot matrix.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(GGally)

widepivot |> 
  select("Chapel Hill","Durham","Raleigh") |> 
  ggpairs()
```

## Motivation: Reproducible Reports

Quarto provides a straightforward way to create reports that combine code and the output from that code with text commentary. This allows for the creation of automated, reproducible reports. Quarto can knit together your analysis results with text and output it directly into HTML, PDF, or Word documents. In fact, we have been using Quarto to generate the webpage for all of our R Open Labs workshops!

### Note: R Markdown

Quarto is very similar to an older tool, R Markdown, that these workshops were originally created in. Quarto and R Markdown syntax and behind the scenes functionality are similar, but Quarto is designed to be more compatible with other languages like Python and Julia. In most cases, you can convert old R Markdown .Rmd documents into Quarto documents with no changes.

## Quarto Structure

Quarto has three components.

1.  An (optional) header in a language called YAML. This allows you to specify the type of output file and configure other options.
2.  R code chunks wrapped by ```` ``` ````
3.  Text mixed with simple formatting markup.

To create a new Quarto document (.qmd), select File -\> New File -\> Quarto Document.

You will have the option to select the output: we'll use the default HTML for this workshop. Give the document a title and enter your name as author: this will create the header for you at the top of your new .html page! RStudio will create a new Quarto document filled with examples of code chunks and text.

### Header

```{verbatim}
---
title: "beginR: Joining, Reshaping & Reproducible Reports"
author: 
  name: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
execute:
  echo: true
format: 
  html:
    theme: spacelab
    toc: true
    toc-location: left
    page-layout: article
---
```

At the top of the page is the optional Yet Another Markup Language (YAML) header. This header is a powerful way to edit the formatting of your report (e.g. figure dimensions, presence of a table of contents, identifying the location of a bibliography file).

### Code Chunks

````{verbatim}
```{r}
#| label: setup
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
```
````

R code chunks are surrounded by ```` ``` ````. Inside the curly braces, it specifies that this code chunk will use R.

`#|` precedes options for this code chunk.  In this case:

* `#| label: setup` names this chunk "setup". (Names are optional)
* `#| warning: false` tells Quarto to hide any warnings generated by our code in the final HTML document.

Finally the code `library(tidyverse)` is executed as usual.  When creating a document, you can use the buttons at the top right of the code chunk to run all code before and run the code in this block respectively.  

Use CTRL+ALT+i (PC) or CMD+OPTION+i (Mac) to insert R code blocks.

### Formatted Text

````{verbatim}
## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:
````

![](figures/text.png)

This is plain text with simple formatting added. The `##` tells Quarto that "Quarto" and "Running Code are section headers. The `**` around "Render" tells Quarto to make that word **bold**.

The Posit team has helpfully condensed these code chunk and text formatting options into a [cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/quarto.pdf).

You can get pretty far with options in the Quarto cheatsheet, but Quarto is a very powerful, flexible language that we do not have time to fully cover. More detailed references are available here: <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html>

### Visual Editor

R Studio provides a visual editor for Quarto documents. This can be accessed by toggling between the "Source" and "Visual" options in the top left corner of your Qmd script editor pane.

Once activated, this interface is similar to a word processing software like Microsoft Word - shortcuts for bolding, italics, etc. are usually the same and there are icons and drop down menus available for lists, bullets, links, and more.

You can still use CTRL+ALT+i (PC) or CMD+OPTION+i (Mac) to insert R code blocks, or use the Insert\>Code Chunk\>R menu in the visual editor.

Read more about the visual editor here:\
<https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/>

## Generating the HTML document

Click the **Render** button, and R Studio will generate an HTML report based on your document.

Let's try creating an Quarto document to explore the US cheese consumption data and review what we learned in weeks 1-3.

````{verbatim}
###Data Import

```{r}
consumption <- read_csv("data/clean_cheese.csv")
```

### Useful functions for exploring dataframes

Include one of the following in your document. We've used `eval = FALSE` here to prevent this code chunk from running!

```{r}
#| label: misc
#| eval: FALSE
head(consumption)
tail(consumption)
summary(consumption)
```

### Tables and `knitr::kable`

By default, Quarto will display tables the way they appear in the R console. We can use `knitr::kable function` to get cleaner tables.

```{r}
#| label: kable
knitr::kable(head(consumption), caption = "The first six rows of the cheese consumption data")
```

### Adding a new variable

We've covered two ways to add a new variable to a dataframe.

**Note:** R allows non-standard variable names that include spaces, parentheses, and other special characters. The way to refer to variable names that contain wonky symbols is to use the backtick symbol `` ` ``, found at the top left of your keyboard with the tilde `~`.

The base R way covered in lesson 1 using the `$` operator and `with()` function

```{r}
#| label: ratio1
#| error: TRUE
#Base R way, covered in lesson 1
consumption$amer_ital_ratio <- with(consumption, `Total American Cheese` / `Total Italian Cheese`)
```

Oops. Better check the variable names.

```{r}
#| label: ratio2
consumption$amer_ital_ratio1 <- with(consumption, `Total American Chese` / `Total Italian Cheese`)
```

The tidyverse way covered in lesson 3 using the `mutate()` function

```{r}
#| label: ratio3
#Tidyverse way, covered in lesson 3
consumption <- mutate(consumption, amer_ital_ratio2 = `Total American Chese` / `Total Italian Cheese`)
```

### Selecting Columns

```{r}
#| label: select
consumption <- select(consumption, Year, Cheddar, Mozzarella, `Cream and Neufchatel`)

```

### Renaming Columns

```{r}
#| label: rename
consumption <- rename(consumption, Cream_and_Neufchatel = `Cream and Neufchatel`)
```

### Plotting

```{r}
#| label: plot1
#| fig.width: 8
#| fig.height: 5
ggplot(consumption, aes(x = Year)) + 
    geom_point(aes(y = Cheddar, col = "Cheddar")) + 
    geom_point(aes(y = Mozzarella, col = "Mozzarella")) + 
    geom_point(aes(y = Cream_and_Neufchatel, col = "Cream and Neufchatel")) +
    ylab("Consumption in Pounds Per Person")

```
````

## Bibliography

Quarto also provides a nifty way to incorporate a bibliography and references. We'll haven an example of this in the exercises, but here's a brief summary of the steps required to use a BibTex bibliography.

1.  Create a plain-text .bib file in the same directory as your .qmd document.
2.  Fill that .bib file with BibTex citations. Many academic databases or the [Citation Machine](http://www.citationmachine.net/bibtex/cite-a-book) can generate the BibTex citations for you.
3.  Make sure each citation has a unique citation-key, the first entry
4.  Add a bibliography field to the YAML header that tells Quarto the name of your bibliography file, for example `bibliography: references.bib`
5.  Add citations throughout the document using square brackets.

## Exercises

### Merge and Reshape

All of today's exercises involve the datasets included in [brazilian-commerce-subset.zip](data/brazilian-ecommerce-subset.zip).

1.  Read olist_public_dataset_v2.csv into R. Explore the dataset. If necessary, refer to the metadata provided [here](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).

2.  Read product_category_name_translation.csv into R. Merge this dataframe into olist_public_dataset_v2.csv using `product_category_name` as the key variable.

    Let's explore which products are most frequently purchased together:

3.  Use `group_by` and `summarize` to find the total `order_items_qty` for each `product_category_name_english` in each `customer state`. [Review](https://unc-libraries-data.github.io/R-Open-Labs/week3_Transformations/R_OpenLabs_3_Transformations.html)

4.  Use `pivot_wider` to create a new dataframe with a row for each `customer_state` and a column for each `product_category_name_english`. Name this dataframe `products`.

5.  Run the two lines of code below (make sure your dataframe from step 4 is called `products`!)

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    products <- ungroup(products) #remove grouping 

    products[is.na(products)] <- 0 #replace missing data with zeroes
    ```

6.  Use `ggpairs` or other Exploratory Data Analysis techniques to look for relationships between purchases of `small_appliances`,`consoles_games`,`air_conditioning`, and `construction_tools_safety`. (Remember to run `library(GGally)` before using `ggpairs`).

7.  Repeat problems 3-6 with `order_products_value` (i.e. the amount spent vs the quantity purchased). Do you see different patterns? Explore other product categories.

8.  Use `pivot_longer` and then `pivot_wider` to convert your `products` dataframe to one where each row is a different `product_category_name_english` and each column represents a different `customer_state`.

9.  Choose 5 states. Which of these states have the most similar patterns of spending (as measured by correlation)?

### Quarto

10. [Download the cheese RStudio Project](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries-data/R-Open-Labs/raw/main/Join_Reshape_Reports/download/cheese.zip) file and extract the R Project contained within. Then, render the cheeseConsumption.qmd report. It should generate an HTML report for you.

11. In the cheeseConsumption.qmd file, find the code chunk named **setup**. change `#| echo: FALSE` to `#| echo: TRUE`. Try knitting the document again. What changed? Did this affect the whole document?

12. In the cheeseConsumption.qmd file, find the code chunk named **import**. change `#| message: FALSE` to `#| message: TRUE`. Try knitting the document again. What changed? Did this affect the whole document?

13. Create another Quarto document analyzing cheese production data contained in the state_milk_productions.csv file. You can use the data dictionary found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-01-29) to make sense of the different variables. **Hint**: you'll need to use the group-by %\>% summarize idiom [we learned in Week 3](https://unc-libraries-data.github.io/R-Open-Labs/week3_Transformations/R_OpenLabs_3_Transformations.html#piping) to sum up all the state level data within each year. You'll probably want to feed the output from that group-by %\>% summarize step into knitr::kable() to get a prettier table for your report.

14. Once you have created an Quarto report analyzing cheese production, send the entire R Project to a friend (or us!) and ask them to knit that .qmd document. If they have RStudio and the tidyverse installed, they should be able to seamlessly generate the exact report you generated, without having to make any changes.
